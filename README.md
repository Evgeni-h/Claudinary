The project contains selenium framework and selenium tests folders.
In tests folders there is only one test, the exercise test.
The test is written in simplest way that can be, without defined objects/enums/variables etc. All the functionality is done in SeleniumFramework.
There are many static functions in the framework and thats because my purpose  was to make tests as simple as possible. (Thats my favorite structure of writing tests and framework with selenium).
Of course there are improvements that can be done in test and framework. (Can talk about it if we continue to next step).
